# Shadcn/UI Block Viewer: Bridging the Gap in Modern Web Development

## Overview
The UI Block Viewer is a sophisticated component that enables developers to seamlessly switch between preview and code views of UI components, offering two distinct template modes: Base and Advanced.

## Template Modes

### Base Mode
- Simplified, clean implementations
- Perfect for quick prototyping
- Focused on core functionality
- Ideal for learning and understanding component structure

### Advanced Mode
- Feature-rich implementations
- Complex interactions and animations
- Advanced styling and responsive design
- Production-ready code with best practices

## Technical Foundation

Built on top of shadcn/ui, which has become the de facto standard for React component development due to:
- Copy-paste architecture instead of package dependencies
- Full component customisation flexibility
- Type-safe with TypeScript
- Built on Radix UI primitives ensuring accessibility
- Zero vendor lock-in
- Modern styling with Tailwind CSS
